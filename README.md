## Overview

The goal of this EDA is to uncover the relationships between certain variables and `profit`. By conductive univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, we were able to establish that the variable `revenue` had the greatest impact on `profit`. 

## Folder Format

In this folder, you will find the qmd and html documents of the final EDA as well as the executive summary. You will also find the .gitignore file that allowed me to ignore large datasets so it would commit. All of the other important contents used to create this EDA are in sub directories.
