## Overview

This subdirectory includes that raw data saved as `movies_data`. This includes the unfiltered and untidy data that was originally provided by the Kaggle website. The data includes movies from 1865-2023 instead of filtering for movies within the last century. It also does not include the `split_genres` column that was created with a string.
