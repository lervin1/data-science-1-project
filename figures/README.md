## Overview

This subdirectory contains the figures that are displayed in the qmd and html documents through the `ggsave()` function. The figures are a variation of different visualizations, such as scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots. These figures ultimatley add to the EDA in a sense where they help the reader truly visualize the relationships between certain variables and `profit`.
