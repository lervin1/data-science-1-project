## Overview

This subdirectory includes the qmd and html documents for progress memo 1 & 2.

Progress memo 1 instructed us to choose a dataset and briefly analyze it to come up with research questions that interested us. It challenged us to find potential roadblocks with the data that we would have to tackle in the EDA.

Progress memo 2 instructed us to showcase significant progress with our EDA and have a research question we would like to focus on. It challenged us to create visualizations for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to display our progress with our research question.
